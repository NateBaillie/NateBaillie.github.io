<p>My name is Nate Baillie. I am a senior at Armstrong and live in Ford City. I have been playing football for eight years and have been playing basketball for nine years. My favorite sport is football. My favorite subject is math. I also enjoy some science classes and computer classes. Over my years in high school, I have both learned and grown into the person I am. I plan on going to college and play football along with getting a good education. I would like to major in actuarial science with the back-up plan of being a math teacher and football coach.
